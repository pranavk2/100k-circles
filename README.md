# A Simple CUDA Renderer

In this project, we render 100K+ circles using CUDA on a square shaped canvas.

We assume that composition is not commutative. That is, Circle X over Circle Y does not look the same as Circle Y Circle X. As such, we must render circles in a manner that follows the order as given.
